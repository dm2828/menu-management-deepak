Setting Up Your Laravel Application
Follow these steps to set up and run your Laravel application:

Step 1: Run Composer Command
Make sure you have Composer installed on your machine. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download it from getcomposer.org.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to your Laravel project directory:



cd /path/to/your/laravel/project
Run the following Composer command to install the necessary dependencies:



composer install
Step 2: Check Your Environment Database Connection
Ensure that your database connection is correctly set in the .env file located at the root of your project. Open this file and look for the following lines:

dotenv

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
Replace your_database_name, your_database_user, and your_database_password with your actual database credentials.
Step 3: Run Migration Command
Once your database connection is set up, you need to run migrations to create the necessary database tables:

Run the following command:



php artisan migrate
This command will create all the tables defined in your migration files.

Step 4: Clear All Cache Before Starting
Before you start the application, it's a good practice to clear any cached files to ensure everything runs smoothly:

Run the following commands:



php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:clear
These commands will clear the configuration cache, route cache, and compiled view files.

Step 5: Run Artisan Serve to Start
To start your Laravel application, you can use the built-in Artisan server:

Run the following command:



php artisan serve
This command will start the server, and you will see an output indicating where the application is running, typically at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Step 6: Register Your Account
Since youâ€™re using Laravel Breeze for authentication, you need to register an account to access the application.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/register.
Fill in the registration form with your credentials (name, email, password, etc.).
Click on the Register button.
Step 7: Perform CRUD Operations for Menu
Now that you are logged in, you can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the menu:

Create a Menu Item: Navigate to the menu creation page (usually something like /menus/create), fill out the form, and submit it.

Read Menu Items: Go to the menu index page (usually /menus) to view all menu items.

Update a Menu Item: Find the menu item you wish to update, click the edit button (usually something like Edit), modify the details, and submit the form.

Delete a Menu Item: On the menu index page, locate the delete button next to the menu item you want to remove and confirm the deletion.
